This is a space shooting game using c language. 
The player has to fire the missile and hit the enemy ships and also avoid getting hit by the enemy missiles. 
I have used ncurses in this program. 
This game has three modes and three difficulty levels. 
You can buy weapons and erase the previous highscores. 
I have left colors in comments so that anyone who wants to add the color can simply uncomment it.
I have uploaded screenshots and video of the game along with the code.
